# Code for my thesis : 
I wish I should have documented this code better. But alas it has been 4 years since I last worked on this. Probably a task for ChatGPT and alike someday. Till then archiving this.  
I can help you if you have questions on a specific piece of code. Feel free to reach out on [diveshuttamchandani@gmail.com](mailto:diveshuttamchandani@gmail.com)

# Overall Idea :
The main idea behind the code is to predict network polling intervals by looking at curvature instead of rate (double derivative instead of single derivative).
Other details can be found in the paper [An Efficient Method to Collect Statistics in SDN Using Curvature-Based Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9334029)
